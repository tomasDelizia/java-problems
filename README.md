# Java Programming Exercises

This project contains a collection of solutions to common programming problems in Java. It is organized into different
packages covering topics such as arrays, matrices, data structures, and classic algorithms.

## Project Structure

- `src/main/java/com/tomasdelizia/array/`: Utilities and algorithms for working with arrays (searching, sorting,
  merging).
- `src/main/java/com/tomasdelizia/backtracking/`: Backtracking algorithms for problems like 8-Queens.
- `src/main/java/com/tomasdelizia/dynamic/`: Dynamic programming solutions for problems like Fibonacci sequence,
  coin change, and longest common subsequence.
- `src/main/java/com/tomasdelizia/graph/`: Implementation of Graph data structure.
- `src/main/java/com/tomasdelizia/greedy/`: Greedy algorithms for problems like coin change.
- `src/main/java/com/tomasdelizia/hash/`: Implementation of hash table with separate chaining collision resolution
 technique.
- `src/main/java/com/tomasdelizia/heap/`: Implementations of binary heap, a.k.a. a priority queue.
- `src/main/java/com/tomasdelizia/linkedlist/`: Implementations of singly and doubly linked lists, along with
  common operations.
- `src/main/java/com/tomasdelizia/matrix/`: Functions for matrix manipulation and operations.
- `src/main/java/com/tomasdelizia/queue/`: Implementation of a queue data structure.
- `src/main/java/com/tomasdelizia/recursion/`: Examples of recursive algorithms and problems.
- `src/main/java/com/tomasdelizia/sort/`: Various sorting algorithms including quicksort and mergesort.
- `src/main/java/com/tomasdelizia/stack/`: Implementation of a stack data structure.
- `src/main/java/com/tomasdelizia/string/`: String manipulation and searching algorithms.
- `src/main/java/com/tomasdelizia/tree/`: Binary search tree and n-ary tree implementations, along with traversal
  algorithms.
